"""A plan turn that ran out of output budget is not a successful plan turn.

``truncation.py`` reads the provider's own machine-readable stop flag, and
every metered surface in ``server.py`` records a length stop as ``truncated``.
The subscription surface did not: ``shim.subscription_passthrough`` recorded
``ok`` for every response below HTTP 400 without ever looking at the flag. Two
things went wrong at once, and the second is the worse one:

* the failure disappeared - a turn that spent plan quota without finishing the
  answer read exactly like one that finished;
* the same turn was added to the ``ok`` side of the denominator
  ``outcome_memory`` divides truncations by (it counts ``ok`` and ``truncated``
  and nothing else), so the observed truncation rate was *diluted* rather than
  merely incomplete - and that rate is what the avoidance evidence rests on.

These tests pin the repaired behaviour on both shapes a plan answer arrives in
- one JSON body, and the SSE stream Claude Code actually uses - and pin what
must not change with it: the bytes on the wire, the plan being charged either
way, the ledger's freedom from prompt, answer and credential text, and the
separation between what was observed and what was only estimated.

Nothing here opens a socket: the Anthropic upstream is an in-process fake.

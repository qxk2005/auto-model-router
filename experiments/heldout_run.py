"""Runner for the pre-registered held-out evaluation.

Each task is sent to two arms with an identical prompt:

``router``   the configured policy makes the route choice per task.
``control``  the *normal* single-model behaviour: one capable model for
             everything, chosen from the catalog by capability, with no
             per-task switching. This is the ordinary default, not an
             intentionally expensive straw man, and its name is recorded in
             every row of the ledger and in the report.

Spend control
-------------
Every call goes through ``experiments.llm.Client``, which appends to a JSONL
ledger and refuses to start a call once the cap is reached. The cap is a hard
argument, has no default, and is enforced against the *higher* of billed and
list-price cost. A run that hits the cap stops and the report says which
categories were completed.

Isolation
---------
Generated coding answers are executed only through ``experiments.sandbox``
(Bubblewrap: no network, no home, private tmpfs). The runner refuses to grade
the coding category at all if ``sandbox.preflight()`` does not confirm real
isolation; those tasks are then recorded as excluded with the exact reason,
never silently run on the host.

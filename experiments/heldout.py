"""Pre-registered held-out evaluation across six task categories.

The categories are the ones the next cycle asked for: web/UI design, coding,
maths/reasoning, factual research, summarisation, and cache-eligible repeat
tasks.

Pre-registration
----------------
``python experiments/heldout.py preregister`` writes the task set, the grader
for each task, the analysis plan and a SHA-256 of the task file, **before any
model is called**. The runner refuses to start unless a pre-registration
exists and its digest still matches the task file, so tasks cannot be quietly
edited after an outcome is seen. The digest appears in the ledger and in the
report.

Paired comparison
-----------------
Every task is run twice on the same prompt, in the same process, against the
same catalog: once through the router's policy and once through the *control*
policy, which is the ordinary "one capable model for everything" behaviour a
normal setup has. The control is a real default, not an inflated one, and it is
named in the report.

What is measured per task
-------------------------
classification, selected route, estimated cost and success probability
(before), then observed pass/fail, latency, tokens, cache status and cost
(after).

``TaskOutcome`` is a **flat analysis row**, not a decision record: one line per
(task, arm) so the ledger can be loaded into a table without unnesting. The
four-object separation lives in ``auto_router.decision`` and is what the router
itself writes; this file mirrors selected fields from it, and every field that
came from an estimate is named ``estimated_*`` so the two can never be summed
together by accident. A control-arm row has no classification and no estimate,
because the control does not classify or forecast - those fields are ``None``,
not zero.

Labels
------
Every number in the report is tagged ``live`` (a real paired call made in this
run), ``replay`` (recomputed from an earlier run's stored answers) or
``estimate`` (the router's own forecast). They are never mixed into one figure.

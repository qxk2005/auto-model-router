"""``route-run``: pick the tool for a job, then start that tool's own client.

The router's other surface is an HTTP endpoint that answers a request itself.
This one answers a different question - *which program should do this work* -
and then gets out of the way::

    route-run "add a retry with backoff to the upload client and run the tests"

It classifies the task, prices every configured route for a job of this shape,
picks one, and executes that route's own command line: a subscription coding
agent through its official CLI, a metered API model through whichever client
you use for those, a free model through a local runner. The task text and the
child's output flow through unchanged; nothing intercepts, rewrites or
inspects the traffic between that client and its provider.

That property is the point. A flat-rate plan is sold for use through its own
client, and the launcher keeps it that way: the official binary runs, signed in
the way its vendor documents, with its own credentials, and the only thing the
router contributes is the choice of *which* binary to start and with which
model flag. Nothing here reads, stores or forwards anybody's login.

What it records is the same four-part decision record the HTTP surface writes
(``decision.py``), so a launched job and a routed turn sit in one ledger:
what the task was, which routes were considered and why one won, what the run
was estimated to cost, and what actually happened - exit status and wall time,
which is all an external client reports back. A subscription run carries no
per-token cost to measure, and none is invented.

Configuration is the ordinary model config with a ``runner`` block per route::

    models:
      - name: plan-strong
        provider: anthropic
        subscription: claude
        runner:
          cmd: [claude, -p, --model, opus]
          stdin: true
          clear_env: [ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN]

``clear_env`` matters more than it looks: for both major coding subscriptions,
a credential variable left in the environment silently moves the run from the
plan to per-token billing. The launcher clears the named variables for the
child process only, and records that it did.

The child does **not** inherit the launcher's environment. It gets an
allowlist - :data:`BASE_ENV_ALLOW` (locale, ``PATH``, ``HOME`` and the like,
no credential), plus the names a route asks for with ``env_pass`` or
``env_from``, plus anything the operator adds for every route::

    launcher:
      env_allow: [HTTPS_PROXY]     # passed to every launched route
      cwd_root: ~/code             # --cwd must lie inside this directory
      inherit_env: false           # true = pre-0.4 behaviour: the whole environment

A worker is often a cheap third-party model with a shell; whatever is in its
environment is one prompt injection away from being printed. So a key only
reaches the route that names it.

The child runs in a process group of its own, and a timeout, ``Ctrl-C`` or a
``SIGTERM`` to the launcher ends that whole group, not just the child
(:mod:`auto_router.procs`).

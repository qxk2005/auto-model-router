"""Check a cheap route's answer with Jev, and escalate when it falls short.

The router chooses a model; until now it never looked at what came back. For a
frontier route that is the only honest option - the judge is not smarter than
the thing it would be grading, and a judge that is weaker than the model
produces false alarms, not quality. For the cheap tier the relation is the
other way round: Jev is a typed-question model of roughly frontier-level
reasoning answering one narrow question about an answer a much smaller model
produced, and the 17 September evaluation measured it catching 85 % of wrong
coding answers and 67 % of wrong maths answers with no false alarms
(EXPERIMENTS.md section 4).

So this module verifies exactly the cases where that evidence exists:

* the answering route is in the **cheap tier** (free, ``:free``, or a list
  price at or below ``max_price_per_mtok``) and its capability evidence stays
  below ``max_capability``;
* the request is **self-contained** - the judge sees the request and the
  answer and nothing else, so a question about a document it cannot read is
  the one measured case where it produces false alarms, and is skipped;
* a judge is configured at all.

Everything else is recorded as "not verified", with the reason, and the turn
behaves exactly as it did before this module existed.

What a failed check does
------------------------
``Verdict.escalate`` is true when ``p_adequate`` is below the threshold for
that category. The router then re-runs the turn on the next candidate by its
own expected-cost ranking that is *more capable* than the one that failed
(``Router.escalate`` -> ``Policy.on_failure``), which also raises the
conversation's difficulty floor so the next turn in the same conversation does
not start below the level this one just proved it needs.

Thresholds and the measured rates that go with them live in the config under
``policy.verify``; the defaults here are the ones the calibration in
``experiments/verify_calibrate.py`` chose on the 78-task set.

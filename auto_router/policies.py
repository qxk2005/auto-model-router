"""Routing policies.

All policies share one interface so the simulator and the live router run the
exact same code:

    choice = policy.choose(conversation, request, ctx)       # before a user turn
    retry  = policy.on_failure(conversation, request, ctx, failed_model)

Decisions are made at *user-turn* boundaries. Inside an agent's tool loop
(the request ends with a tool result) the router stays on the model that
started the turn: switching mid-loop throws away a cache that is seconds old
and hands a half-finished plan to a different model.

Policies
--------
A  static      one fixed strong model.
B  naive       per turn, the cheapest model (list price) whose predicted success
               clears a bar. Ignores the cache.
C  ev_switch   B's target, but a downgrade only happens when the saving over a
               horizon beats P(target insufficient) x cost of redoing the turn.
D  escalate    start on the cheapest adequate model, escalate on a failure
               signal, remember the escalation; downgrade only when the
               escalated model's cache has expired or the saving over the
               horizon beats the risk.
E  D + subscription tier priced by quota pacing (quota.py).
F  expected    minimise expected total cost = call cost (cache-aware) +
               P(fail) x [P(detected) x retry cost + P(undetected) x stakes],
               over a horizon, with difficulty memory and the subscription tier.

When an answer judge is configured (``verify.py``), F prices it too. Detection
stops being a property of the user and becomes a property of the route: a cheap
route whose failures are caught by a $0.0004 check is worth more than an
equally cheap route whose failures reach the user, and the judge's own cost and
its false alarms are charged against that gain. Nothing else about the ranking
changes, and a route the judge is not allowed to grade is priced exactly as
before.

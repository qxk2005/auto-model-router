"""Claude Code in front of the router: the gateway path.

Point Claude Code at the router::

    ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 claude

This is the configuration Anthropic documents for an LLM gateway, and what
happens to billing depends on one thing only - whether a *gateway credential*
is set as well:

* No gateway credential: "a saved claude.ai login remains the active
  credential, so its usage limits and billing apply", and a gateway forwarding
  that traffic to Anthropic "must forward the OAuth capability in
  ``anthropic-beta``" (code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway). The request is
  therefore forwarded byte for byte, headers included, and the turn is billed
  to the plan exactly as if the router were not in the path.
* ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`` / ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` / ``apiKeyHelper`` set: "the
  credential replaces the subscription login for that session, and the
  subscription's usage limits don't apply" (same page). The traffic is metered
  against that credential, and the router treats the Claude route like any
  other metered route.

Two guardrails live here, both about the first case:

1. A subscription credential is only ever forwarded to Anthropic
   (``plan_auth.check_upstream``). It is somebody's live Claude login; no
   routing decision is worth handing it to a third party.
2. On subscription traffic the router does not silently change what Claude Code
   asked for. By default it forwards and records the decision it *would* have
   made (``AUTO_ROUTER_SUBSCRIPTION_MODE``), because Anthropic "doesn't support
   routing Claude Code to non-Claude models through any gateway".

The credential is forwarded but never logged, stored, or put into an error
message; ``redact`` is applied to every header dict that reaches a log line.
This is for one person's own Claude Code sessions on their own plan: Anthropic
does not permit developers "to route requests through Free, Pro, or Max plan
credentials on behalf of their users" (code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance).

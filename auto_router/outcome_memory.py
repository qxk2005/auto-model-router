"""What earlier attempts on comparable requests actually did, and nothing else.

``truncation.py`` decides whether *one* answer ran out of output budget, and the
server retries that turn on another route. Until now the lesson stopped there:
the next comparable request went straight back to the route that had just run
out of budget, because nothing on the selection side ever saw the observation.
The 18 September design run showed why that matters - the route that burned a
12,000-token budget did it on both of the hardest tasks, i.e. repeatedly, and
no capability score predicted it.

This module is that missing memory, kept deliberately small and conservative:

* **Observations only.** It is fed from ``ObservedOutcome.status`` - the
  provider's own stop flag, via ``truncation.py`` - and never from an estimate,
  a success probability or a judge's verdict. ``ok`` and ``truncated`` are the
  only statuses it counts: a 5xx says the route was unavailable, not that it
  cannot finish, and ``not_taken`` says nothing about the route at all.
* **Comparable means the same category and the same output-budget bucket.**
  Running out of budget is a property of a route *and* a budget; a route that
  cannot finish a page in 12,000 tokens says nothing about a 500-token answer.
  The ``"default"`` bucket means the caller stated no budget at all, so only a
  request that really stated none may land in it: the server edge rejects a
  malformed ``max_tokens`` outright rather than let it fall through
  (``explicit_budget`` below, ``server.explicit_max_tokens``).
* **A stated evidence basis, or no effect.** A route is avoided only after
  ``min_truncations`` observed length stops that are at least ``min_rate`` of
  its recent observed outcomes for that key, within ``ttl_s``. One truncation is
  a retry (already handled by the server), not a pattern.
* **Only when a usable fallback exists.** Avoidance never removes the last
  route; the router keeps the policy's choice and says why.
* **Nothing identifying is stored.** A key is a route name, a category from a
  fixed vocabulary and a bucket label; an entry is a status word and a time.
  No prompt, answer, provider body or error text can enter it.
* **Cold start is inert.** With no observations every query answers "no
  evidence", so a fresh router routes exactly as it did before this existed.

Nothing here edits a capability score or a success estimate.

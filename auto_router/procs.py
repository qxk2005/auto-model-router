"""Run a launched agent so that a timeout ends *everything* it started.

An agent CLI is a program that starts programs: a shell, a test runner, a
language server, sometimes another agent. ``subprocess.run(timeout=...)``
kills only the direct child, so on a timeout the rest keep running - and keep
writing into the working tree - after the caller has reported the job as
over. Found in review: a delegated worker that "timed out after 1 s" wrote a
file five seconds later.

Here the child starts in a process group of its own (``scope="group"``, used
by the launcher, so an interactive ``route-run`` stays in the user's session)
or in a new session (``scope="session"``, used by the delegate server, whose
launcher then contains its agent in a group *inside* that session). On a
timeout, an interrupt or a ``SystemExit`` every process in that group or
session, plus any descendant still linked by parent id, gets ``SIGTERM``, then
``SIGKILL`` after a short grace period, and the call returns only once none of
them is left alive.

The limit is the kernel's: a descendant that calls ``setsid()`` *and* whose
parent has already exited is no longer linked to the job in any way a process
can see. Containing that needs a cgroup or a sandbox, which is the operator's
choice (README, "Use it as a subagent layer").

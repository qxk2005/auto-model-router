"""MCP tools for handing bounded work from a strong planner to routed workers.

The planner's client remains unchanged. Workers are launched through the normal
job router, never through a subscription route, and the response distinguishes
the router's pre-run cost estimate from measured cost. No launched agent CLI
reports token usage back to the launcher, so ``cost_usd`` is always ``null``.

Boundaries the server enforces, because a worker is usually a cheap
third-party model with a shell:

- **Arguments** are validated against the tool schema before anything runs; a
  malformed call gets a structured error and the server keeps serving.
- **The brief is data.** It follows ``--`` on the launcher's command line, so a
  brief that starts with ``-`` cannot become a launcher option.
- **Working directory.** ``cwd`` must lie inside the delegation root:
  ``AUTO_ROUTER_DELEGATE_ROOT``, or else the directory the server was started
  in (the project the planner's client opened). A root of ``/``, ``$HOME`` or
  a parent of ``$HOME`` is refused as too broad.
- **Environment.** The launcher starts the worker with an allowlist, not the
  planner's environment (``launcher.EnvPolicy``).
- **Time.** ``timeout_s`` ends the launcher's whole session - the launcher,
  the agent and everything the agent started - not just the direct child.
- **Concurrency.** More than one worker never shares a tree: each gets a
  disposable copy of ``cwd``, and the result carries the copy's path and a
  diff against the state the copies started from. Nothing is applied to
  ``cwd`` and nothing a worker wrote is executed by this server; the planner
  reviews the diff and applies what it accepts. A symlink that would lead
  out of a copy is left out of it (``_copy``), so editing a file in the copy
  cannot write through a link into the original tree; a link a worker adds
  is reported in the diff, and ``links_leaving_copy`` names the ones that lead
  out of its copy. The diff reads at most ``DIFF_FILE_LIMIT_BYTES`` of any
  changed file and stops reading once the patch is full; the rest are listed
  in ``not_diffed``. A single worker runs in
  ``cwd`` itself. Tool calls are served one at a time.

"""Jev (TypeSafe System One) as the routing classifier and adequacy judge.

Jev answers typed questions with calibrated probabilities instead of text:

* ``classify``: category (choice), difficulty (score), needs tools / vision /
  long context (noul), is this a follow-up relying on the previous turn (noul),
  and how costly a wrong answer would be (score). One call, questions evaluated
  in parallel.
* ``judge``: "does this response fully and correctly address the request?"
  (noul). Used as a cheap failure signal for escalation when no test or tool
  result is available.

Only a compact summary of the conversation is sent (the truncated last user
message plus tool names and sizes), never the full transcript.

Privacy contract
----------------
``scrub()`` runs on every field before it leaves the process, and always before
truncation, so a secret cannot survive by sitting past the cut. It removes
private-key blocks, ``Authorization``-style strings, ``key=``/``token:``-style
assignments, credentials embedded in URLs, a list of well-known secret shapes
(see ``SECRET_SHAPES``) and the literal value of any environment variable whose
*name* looks credential-like.

This is best effort, not a guarantee. Arbitrary sensitive text with no
recognisable shape - a customer's name, a private document - is not detected
and must not be put in the request in the first place. ``AUTO_ROUTER_JEV_MAX_CHARS``
caps how much of any field is sent at all.
